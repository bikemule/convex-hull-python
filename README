Python 2D Polygon Tools
--------------------

I wrote this script and associated tests as a code test for a company I interviewed for last year. This is not actually currently working. If I had put this in version control in the first place before I started tinkering, it would be working better.

I still believe there was a minor bug with my implementation of the sorting of the points (in counter-clockwise order, for one of the algorithms) or else the line intersection function. It's been so long I can't remember.

Tests
-----

Tests are great! And the company insisted, so I did attempt a test-driven development process. The tests are designed to be used with Nose (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/). Nose looks in the standard locations for any function with the string "test" in it. I find not having to worry about creating a class, setup, teardown, etc. makes the mental barriers to writing unit tests much lower. And Nose extends unittest, so it still has all of that functionality.

Also included is JSON file containing shape data for several shapes.

Usage
-----

Does anyone have an actual use for this?

The package is two classes: Point and Polygon. Pretty self-explanatory, except that can create Point objects with either two separate arguments or a tuple! Amazing flexibility for the end user!

There are also many member functions of the Polygon class that test for convexity, separateness, and other properties of polygons.

If you type <code>python shapes.py shapes.json</code> it will run all of the possible Polygon class's member functions against all the other polygons to  detect containment, separateness, etc.

Hopefully this will help someone learn and provide a fun little challenge to debug if you're a novice programmer and want to debug/improve it.
